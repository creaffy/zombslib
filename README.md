# zombslib

Create and manage artificial connections to [ZombsRoyale.io](https://zombsroyale.io/) servers.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Zombslib is not available through the npm registry, however you can still easily install it like so:

```
npm install https://github.com/creaffy/zombslib
```

A more detailed documentation for this library is available on [ZR Wiki](https://zombsroyale.wiki/zombslib/home/). In case something is not clearly explained there, consider joining our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/E5QWPx6TrX).

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Game Session** <br/>
    Establish and manage live connections to servers over TCP/UDP.

-   **High-Level Events** <br/>
    Subscribe to world updates, RPCs, and social events through a unified event system.

-   **Protocol Reimplementation** <br/>
    Encode or decode all kinds of packets.

-   **Mason Service** <br/>
    Manage parties, friends and enter matchmaking via the MasonService wrapper.

-   **REST API** <br/>
    Simple wrapper for all endpoints.

-   **Entity Utilities** <br/>
    Query players and other world entities by type, UID, or name with convenient lookups.

## üöÄ Usage

Basic in-game bot example:

```ts
import {
    ApiServer,
    EnterWorldResponse,
    Game,
    KillFeedRpc,
    MasonService,
    SocketIOSessionData,
    UdpConnectResponse,
    UdpTick,
} from "zombslib";

const mason = new MasonService();
mason.once("socketIoSessionData", (d: SocketIOSessionData) => {
    mason.createParty();
    mason.setPartyGameMode("Solo");
    mason.setPartyRegion("vultr-la");
    mason.setReady(true);
});

mason.once("partyJoinServer", (server: ApiServer) => {
    const game = new Game(server, { displayName: "Example", udp: true });

    game.once("EnterWorldResponse", (r: EnterWorldResponse) => game.setPlatformRpc("android"));
    game.once("UdpConnectResponse", (r: UdpConnectResponse) => game.startUdpStreamRpc());

    game.on("EntityUpdate", (u: UdpTick) => {
        const me = game.getEntityByUid(game.getMyUid());
        if (me?.tick?.currentAmmo === 0) {
            game.reloadRpc();
        }
    });

    game.on("KillFeedRpc", (rpc: KillFeedRpc) => {
        game.sendChatMessageRpc("Party", `${rpc.killer} KO'd ${rpc.victim}`);
    });
});
```

Here are some more simple usage examples: <br/>

-   **[examples/echo.ts](examples/echo.ts)** - Repeat all chat messages coming from other players.<br/>
-   **[examples/leaderboard.ts](examples/leaderboard.ts)** - Fetch from the API and print the leaderboard.<br/>
-   **[examples/cosmetics.ts](examples/cosmetics.ts)** - Query cosmetics' data by name and equip them in-game.

## üö® Future

We cannot say for sure how long this project is going to be kept up-to-date with the game. However, considering the lack of content updates, probably quite a while. In the meantime, there's still some things that need to be implemented into the codebase, like a comprehensive error handling system, as currently all decoders fail silently.
